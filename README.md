# Get Started With ESP32 OTA

This page is intended to guide users through the OTA procedure for the ESP32. All referenced projects come from the [ESP-IDF OTA examples directory](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/ota), with the exception of Hello World, which can be found [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/get-started/hello_world). The assumption is that you have set up ESP-IDF to version 4.* (e.g., 4.2).
